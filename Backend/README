In order for server to run properly a .env file must be created inside 
the 'backend' folder. The .env file is hidden and must be created each 
time you pull because of the high security needed for the URI key.

The .env file should be written as so (This is just an examaple):

.env
--------------------------------------------------
DATABASE_URI = mongodb+srv://NAME_GOES_HERE:PASSWORD_GOES_HERE@cluster0.frfe2zj.mongodb.net //See chat for full link
PORT = 3000       //Or any port number you choose
---------------------------------------------------

Good luck,
-Blaise
